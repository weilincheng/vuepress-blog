## How to spell check in Visual Studio Code?
When I writing my blog (in Markdown) in VSCode, there is no spelling checker to help me to correct the typo.  

After searching extension marketplace, I find this [Spell Right extension](https://github.com/bartosz-antosik/vscode-spellright) which is a multilingual, offline and lightweight spellchecker. 

## Install
Search for Spell Right from the extension installer within VSCode or execute below line in the command palette (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P):

    ext install ban.spellright
